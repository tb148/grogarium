# Contributing guidelines

For anyone who knows [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) basics: feel free to contribute to this repository! Our code is open source. Be sure to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tb148/grogarium/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Filing [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues)

Found a bug? Report it! Be sure to check if it is already reported by using the search bar [here](https://github.com/tb148/grogarium/issues). If there are no similar issues, you can create a new one. We will take a look at it.

Also, feel free to ask questions, suggest new features, and more.

## Creating [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

Contributions are welcome! Be sure to file an issue first (see above). If you know a fix for that issue, or you know a fix for a different one, you can create a pull request. Fork this repository, create a new branch from the 'master' branch, and make your changes on the new branch. Now, create a pull request on the origin repository (tb148/grogarium). We will review your pull request.

## Contributing rules

- Do one thing in a pull request. Open multiple pull requests if you want to add multiple things. 
- Please write [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). So we can take track of what is added each commit.
- Format your code using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). So we have a unified codestyle.
- Don't remove features unless it's necessary. Add an option to disable some feature instead.
- Keep the configuration file backward compatible all the time.
- We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
